here's an online resume with some links!

the library text adventure is something i made on non-work-time, on a non-work computer*, for fun/snark/advocacy.

*actually, on a chromebook using the web twine 2 interface, which is why i haven't yet gotten the timed-text-replace macro thing working and it's a really long list of bullet points...sorry!
